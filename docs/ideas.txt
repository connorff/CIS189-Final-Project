The idea: Morse code translator
	- The user clicks in a morse code sequence
	- The sequence is translated into English
	- The user can choose to play the audio version of the text

Functionality included:
	- A GUI component
	- Multiple functions
	- Unit Testing
	- Exception handling
	- User input and input validation
	- Output
	- A class

Nine additional bits of functionality included:
	1. Decision structure (if / elif / else)
	2. Looping structure
	3. Inner function
	4. Collection (List / tuple)
	5. Collection (Set / dictionary)
	6. Case-switch statement
	7. Python module / package
	8. Object Oriented Functionality including constructors/methods/objects
	9. Object Oriented Program inheritance/polymorphism including base-derived class

Project proposal:

For the final project, I will create a Morse code translator. The user will have a single button in the GUI which they can use to 
input a sequence of dots, slashes, and spaces in order to construct a string. The user can choose to have the audio version of the
string played.

The list of expectations:
1. GUI with text box for string, button for inputting code, and button for playing audio
2. Give the user ability to input Morse code
3. Translate the Morse code into a string
4. [Optional but possible] give the user the ability to play an audio of the string
